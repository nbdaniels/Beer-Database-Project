# CIS451_Beer-Database-Project

This is my final project for my Database Management course.

I created a database to hold information about beer to be accessed through HTML pages using PHP scripts to manage SQL queries. I managed the mySQL database through terminal and MySQLWorkbench.

Unfortunately, since I no longer have the server set up, I am unable to have access to the database.

In this project there are multiple files:
- "Data Files" folder
    - the original data files in spreadsheet format
- "Database Project Summary" RTF file
    - Summary of the database and the data it holds
- "DatabaseDiagram.mwb" file
    - MySQLWorkbench diagram
- "SchemaDiagram.png"
    - Diagram of database schema
- "server" folder
    - All text, HTML, and PHP files relevant for the connection to the database from the webpage.
