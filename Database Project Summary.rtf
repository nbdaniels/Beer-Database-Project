\f0\fs24 \cf0 This database will hold the information for breweries and the beer that they make. Each brewery makes its own kind of beer. Each kind of beer made is unique and is classified as either a Microbrew or a Macrobrew. Beers have a name given by the brewery that makes it, a type (IPA, Stout, Amber, etc.), and an ABV (alcoholic content of the beer). Beer is created from various ingredients. Every ingredient has its own id and may be used in the creation of different beers across different breweries (i.e. hops are used in a range of beers). When beers are being made, they are put into vats for fermentation. Each vat is associated with a batch of beer that takes time to ferment. Once the beer is done fermenting, it is placed in a warehouse for storage before it's sold or distributed. Ingredients are also stored in warehouses.}
